154 do you take any drugs not prescribed by a doctor
155 what drugs
52 are you sexually active
53 do you feel safe
101 ok, thank you for your time mr. wilkins. i understand your back is in a lot of pain, so i will give your information to the doctor who will be able to hep you
13 hello mr. wilkins. how are you doing
16 i'm sorry to hear that your back is hurting you. hopefully we'll be able to help today.
8 before we begin, are there any other concerns that you have aside from your back pain
8 okay, anything else
156 great. so today we'll have about 15 minutes to go over your back pain and your need to urinate more frequently
60 can you tell me more about your back pain
2 i see. how long ago did this occurr
1 where on your back is the pain
10 how would you describe the pain
11 does it radiate out at all
3 okay, can you tell me whether or not anything makes the pain worse or better
105 oh no, does your work require you to move things often
17 it must be difficult to work with back pain.
157 i'm sorry your experiencing back pain. it must make work difficult
158 has the pain affected your life at home
66 i can see that your back pain is causing you a lot of distress in your daily life.
38 i'm sorry
30 have you ever had back pain before
12 how painful is it for you
5 what makes it better
6 have you taken any other medications
8 are there any other symptoms associated with your back pain
104 okay, so here's what i've got so far: you are experiencing a lot of dull pain in your lower back when you try to do physical activity.
86 what can you tell me about your urination
8 is there anything else you'd like to talk about today
86 tell me more
14 hello mr. wilkins
13 it's nice to see you. how are you doing
89 i'm sorry to hear that. about how long has this been bothering you
30 have you ever had pain like this before
134 i see. a week is quite a long time to have to have this kind of pain. has it been worsening since it started
27 did you notice anything different in your habits before this pain started? say like halping someone move or trying a new exercise
4 what work do you do
159 that sounds very strenuous. have you been able to get any rest since the pain started
160 have you tried doing anything to remedy the pain in the meantime
1 how would you describe this pain? where abouts is it and how does it feel to you
161 does it seem more aching, burning, stabbing, or anything like that
116 is the pain worse after a day of work or upon getting up after sleeping
106 have you been able to rest since you have not been working
39 i can see how that would be frustrating for you. you mentioned never having pain like this before. what, if any, medical history do you have
8 have you ever presented to the doctor before for any other problems
8 do you have any other symptoms you would like to talk about
29 let's talk about your past medical history.
162 i see. that's very fortunate. does your family have any back pain history, or any other medical history you can think of
50 are you currently a smoker
6 that's very good for you. besides the ibuprofen you tried do you take any other medications
49 do you use recreational drugs
163 alright, thank you. let me repeat what i've heard back to you to make sure we are on the same page.
16 that is a very generous attitude to have, and i hope we can get you feeling better soon.
69 so this back pain has been mostly constant dull aching for about a week, and has been keeping you from work, correct
127 okay. ibuprofen has not helped, and you now feel like someone is stepping on you or squeezing hard, which hasn't changed when you have tried small tasks.
8 i see. we will absolutely work on a plan that fits what you are looking for. do you have any other concerns at this time
164 thank you for speaking with me. the doctor will be in to see you shortly.

2 when did this happen
